This is a program that solves the N Queens problem in which we look for a way to put on a chess board(NxN) N queens in such way that they aren´t able to collide or attack each other

For running this program you should use the command "python nQueens.py"
We include as well a unittest where we test the options for N = 4,5, and 10
